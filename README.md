#### What is a river?

riverBrowser works with a documented format called <a href="http://riverjs.org/">river.js</a>. 

It's a reverse-chronologic list of new stories. My <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river4">River4</a> app generates these files. It's an open format, available for anyone to use.

#### Demo app

Here's the <a href="http://fargo.io/code/browsers/riverbrowserdemo.html">demo app</a> for riverBrowser.

I took a snapshot of one of my rivers, so the content would stay fixed. It can be difficult to discuss rivers because they're always changing. This river won't change.
